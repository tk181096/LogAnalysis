# LogAnalysis
For security and efficiency reasons, an operating system will divide up the available physical RAM into units called “pages”. A page fault occurs on your computer when the memory address accessed by the CPU is not valid (i.e. has not been mapped to a page). In this project, I will parse &amp; analyze a log of page faults reported by the operating system of a home desktop computer and try to predict the most likely cause of pagefault.
